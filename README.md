# Web-Crawler-SB
StackBuilders Web Crawler Exercise: This repository contains a JavaScript-based web crawler that utilizes scraping techniques to extract the initial 30 entries from https://news.ycombinator.com/.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SiilverShiine/Web-Crawler-SB.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install jest axios cheerio`
3. Review the code and tests.

## Given instructions
Using the language that you feel most proficient in, you’ll have to create a web crawler using scraping techniques to extract the first 30 entries from https://news.ycombinator.com/ . You’ll only care about the title, the number of the order, the number of comments, and points for each entry.
From there, we want it to be able to perform a couple of filtering operations:
1. Filter all previous entries with more than five words in the title ordered by the number of comments first.
2. Filter all previous entries with less than or equal to five words in the title ordered by points.
